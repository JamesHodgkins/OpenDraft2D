OpenDraft is an open-source 2D CAD project that aims to provide a lightweight, user-friendly, and extendable CAD solution. The project is currently in its early stages of development, focusing on setting up the program structure and core classes. 

## Features

The following features have now been implemented: TBC

## Roadmap

The following roadmap outlines the planned features for OpenDraft:

1. Basic drawing tools (lines, circles, rectangles, etc.): The initial phase will focus on implementing essential drawing tools to enable users to create geometric shapes and objects.

2. Layer management: A layer management system will be introduced to allow users to organize and control the visibility and editing of different elements within their drawings.

3. Snap and grid functionality: To enhance precision and alignment, snap and grid functionality will be incorporated, enabling users to easily align and position objects based on predefined increments.

4. Object selection and manipulation: This feature will enable users to select individual or multiple objects within their drawings and perform various operations such as moving, scaling, rotating, and modifying their attributes.

5. Undo/Redo functionality: Users will be able to undo and redo their actions, providing them with the flexibility to experiment and correct mistakes during the design process.

6. Export to common file formats (DXF, SVG, etc.): OpenDraft will support exporting drawings to popular file formats such as DXF (AutoCAD) and SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics), ensuring compatibility with other design software.

7. Customizable user interface: Users will have the option to customize the interface according to their preferences, allowing them to arrange tools, panels, and menus to create a personalized workspace.

8. Plugin system for extending functionality: A plugin system will be implemented, empowering users to extend the capabilities of OpenDraft by integrating additional tools, features, or integrations developed by third-party developers.

9. Extensive block library of common engineering components including fastenings, piping, electrical etc.

Please note that this roadmap is subject to change as priorities may shift based on user feedback and emerging industry trends. We are committed to continuously improving OpenDraft and delivering a comprehensive CAD software solution.


## Dependencies

OpenDraft currently has the following dependencies, which are included within the project:
- [The OpenGL Extension Wrangler Libary (GLEW)](https://github.com/nigels-com/glew)
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org)
- [NanoVG](https://github.com/memononen/nanovg)
- [pugixml](https://github.com/zeux/pugixml)

## Why Another CAD Package?

While there are already great open-source CAD solutions available, such as LibreCAD and FreeCAD, OpenDraft aims to offer a distinct approach. Here's why we are creating another CAD package:

- **Lightweight**: OpenDraft focuses on providing a lightweight solution, minimizing resource usage while maintaining essential functionality.

- **User-Friendly**: We strive to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface, making the CAD experience more accessible to users, regardless of their level of expertise.

- **Extendable**: OpenDraft aims to be highly extendable through a plugin system, allowing users to customize and enhance the software according to their specific needs.

- **Built from the Ground Up**: By starting from scratch, we have the opportunity to design and implement the core functionalities with a modern and optimized approach.

- **Free Forever**: Our long-term vision is to develop OpenDraft into a professional-grade CAD program that can compete with costly proprietary solutions. By being open source and community-driven, we aim to provide a powerful CAD tool free of charge, eliminating the need for exorbitant pricing

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the creators and contributors of existing open-source CAD solutions, whose invaluable contributions have played a pivotal role in shaping and advancing the field of computer-aided design. Their dedication, expertise, and innovation have paved the way for projects like OpenDraft to exist.

Throughout the development of OpenDraft, we have strived to leverage the collective knowledge and expertise of the open-source community. In doing so, we have consciously utilized certain portions of code from these projects to enhance our software's capabilities and provide a comprehensive CAD experience. We would like to acknowledge that we have knowingly incorporated and adapted code from various open-source CAD projects.

Wherever possible, we have made every effort to ensure that appropriate credit is given to the original creators and contributors of the code we have utilized. We believe that acknowledging their efforts is not only a sign of respect but also a way to foster collaboration and promote the continued growth of the open-source community.

We extend our deepest appreciation to all those who have generously shared their code, ideas, and expertise, enabling us to build upon their work and create OpenDraft. Without their contributions, our journey would have been significantly more challenging, and our software would not be what it is today.

Thank you for your interest in OpenDraft! We are committed to developing a CAD program that not only meets your needs but also exceeds your expectations.
