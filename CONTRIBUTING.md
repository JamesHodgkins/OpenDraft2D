## Contributing to OpenDraft

Thank you for your interest in contributing to OpenDraft! We welcome contributions from the community to help improve and enhance the project. By contributing, you can help make OpenDraft a better CAD solution for everyone.

To contribute, please follow these guidelines:

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the OpenDraft repository to your GitHub account. This will create a copy of the project under your account.

### 2. Set Up Your Development Environment

To set up your development environment, follow these steps:

- **Visual Studio (Optional)**: The OpenDraft repository includes a Visual Studio project for convenience. If you prefer using Visual Studio, you can open the project file (`OpenDraft.sln`) in Visual Studio and build the solution from there. However, note that using Visual Studio is not essential, and you can use any development environment of your choice.

- **Dependencies**: OpenDraft already includes the necessary dependencies within the repository, so there's no need to download or install them separately. The project includes GLFW for handling windows and input, as well as NanoVG for 2D rendering. If you're using a different development environment, ensure that you link against the appropriate versions of GLFW and NanoVG included in the project repository.

- **Building and Running**: To build and run OpenDraft, follow the instructions specific to your development environment. If you're using Visual Studio, open the `OpenDraft.sln` solution file and build the project. For other environments, configure your project settings to include the necessary source files and dependencies.

### 3. Create a Feature Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch for your contribution. This helps in isolating your changes and makes it easier to review and merge them later.

### 4. Make Your Changes

Implement the desired feature, fix a bug, or make improvements to OpenDraft. Write clean and well-documented code following the project's coding conventions and best practices.

### 5. Test Your Changes

Ensure that your changes do not introduce new issues and that existing functionality remains intact. Run the test suite and perform manual testing to validate your modifications.

### 6. Commit and Push

Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages. Push the changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

### 7. Submit a Pull Request

Once you have pushed your changes to your forked repository, navigate to the original OpenDraft repository. From there, you can submit a pull request (PR) to propose your changes for review.

In your PR, provide a detailed description of the changes you have made, including any relevant context or motivation behind them. If your contribution addresses any existing issue or feature request, reference it in your PR description.

### 8. Engage in the Review Process

Your PR will be reviewed by the project maintainers. They may provide feedback, suggest improvements, or ask for clarifications. Be responsive to the review comments and address them promptly.

### 9. Iterate and Refine

Iterate on your changes based on the feedback received. Make additional commits or modifications as necessary until the maintainers are satisfied with the contribution.

### 10. Merge and Celebrate

Once your contribution has been approved, it will be merged into the main branch of OpenDraft. Congratulations! Your changes are now part of the project.
